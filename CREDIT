This code is written by Mohsen Alimomeni. But the following POR implementation was used.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The software POR_SW_private is an implementation of the Shacham-Waters private scheme of the Proof of Retrievability (POR).

The scheme is implemented exactly as described in their paper "Compact Profs of Retreivability". (http://www.springerlink.com/content/q0506q5r27352599/)

The code is written in C++ and compiled using GNU GCC compiler

The follwoing open source libraries needs to be installed for compiling:

1. GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic library (GMP library)   (http://gmplib.org/)
 
2. OpenSSL Library (http://www.openssl.org)

The runtime parameters (those controlled by the user) are:

1. str: location of the input file

2. l: size of the challenge set

3. seed: number to initialize the C++ inbuilt random number generator

For compiling, use the provided makefile. (Just run "make") 

For execution, run the generated executable file main.exe. (using "./main")
