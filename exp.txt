Aim:
=================

We wish to verification the location of our files in the cloud.  Our scheme will combine a PoR (proof of retrievability) scheme and a geolocation scheme.  

A PoR is a challenge-response protocol which verifies that a file is being stored.

A geolocation scheme translates the round trip times between "landmark nodes" (with known locations) and a node (with unknown location) into distances and then uses triangulation to determine the location of the measured node.

In the experiment we want to study how the time to compute a PoR response (at the measured node) affects are ability to accurately translate round trip times into distances.

(We will only concentrate on nodes in north america and europe.)

Amazon EC2
--------------
In the final part of the experiment we will aim to verify the location of a file stored in 3 different amazon regions.  For this we will need a virtual machine in the following three amazon regions: US-west, US-east and Europe.


POR
--------------
The PoR we shall use will be the privately verifiable scheme by Shacham and Waters.
We can either use the implementation by Sanchit or the one given on google code by Z. Peterson of Postgrad Naval College (https://code.google.com/p/compact-proofs-of-retrievability/).



---------------
Experiments:
===============

Learning phase 1: (timing file retreival)
-For every pair of planetlab nodes A,B
-Measure the time for A to retrieve the first line of a file stored at B.
-We can then use the times to find a line of best fit which translates time into distance.

Learning phase 2: (timing with POR)
-For every pair of planetlab nodes A,B
-Measure the time for B to respond to a PoR challenge issued by A.
-We can then use the times to find a line of best fit which translates time into distance.

Location Verification:
-In each of the amazon regions: US-east, US-west and Europe create a virtual machine that will be viewed as a storage server.
-Using the planetlab nodes we find time measurements to the virtual machine in each of the regions for both the basic file retrieval case and the PoR case.
-Using the equations for our best-fit lines for the two cases we can then geolocate each virtual machine using triangulation.
-we can then study the difference between the areas we obtain in the basic file retrieval case, the PoR case and the actual Region itself for each virtual machine.
